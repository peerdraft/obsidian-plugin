# Secure real-time collaboration for Obsidian

**tl;dr** Peerdraft enables hassle-free collaboration in Obsidian with secure, one-time links. No account or Obsidian installation is needed for peers. Changes are exchanged directly, and sessions end upon document closure, ensuring privacy.

## It just works

Start a session from within Obsidian and you get a secret and unguessable link. Your peers can use this link to join with their browsers instantly. They don't need a Peerdraft account or Obsidian installed.

## Your documents are safe

Your document and all changes are exchanged securly and directly between you and your peers. The Peerdraft servers are only used to establish the connections.

## Close and forget

As soon as you close your document in Obsidian, the session stops automatically. Updates will not be shared anymore and the secret link stops working. When you start a new session, a new link will be created.

## Obsidian-to-Obsidian sync available

Your collaborators can use the web editor or the Peerdraft Obsidian plugin to join a session. If they join a session from within Obsidian, a new document will be created and kept in sync as long as the session is active and they don't close the document.

## How to get started

Visit [https://www.peerdraft.app](https://www.peerdraft.app) to create an account and get started. There is a "Forever Free" plan available.

## How to use

### Work on a document together

* Open the document you want to work on together.
* Run the command `Start working together on this document`. A secret link will be copied to your clipboard automatically.
* Send this link to your collaborators and start working together.

### Close a session

The session will be closed automatically, when you close the document in Obsidian. You can also:

* Run the command `Start working together on this document` OR
* Click on the `Sharing [filename]` entry in the statusbar and select `stop shared session`.

### Join a session

When you received a link to a Peerdraft session from someone else, you can also use the `Join session and add document from someone else` command. After you entered the URL, a new file will be created and you can start working together.
