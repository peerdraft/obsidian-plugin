# Secure real-time collaboration for Obsidian

**tl;dr** Peerdraft enables hassle-free collaboration in Obsidian with secure, one-time links. No account or Obsidian installation is needed for peers. Changes are exchanged directly, and sessions end upon document closure, ensuring privacy.

## It just works

Start a session from within Obsidian and you get a secret and unguessable link. Your peers can use this link to join with their browsers instantly. They don't need a Peerdraft account or Obsidian installed.

## Your documents are safe

Your document and all edits are exchanged securly and directly between you and your peers. The Peerdraft servers are only used to establish the connections.

## Close and forget

As soon as you close your document in Obsidian, the session stops automatically. Updates will not be shared anymore and the secret link stops working. When you start a new session, a new link will be created.

## How to get started

Visit [https://www.peerdraft.app](https://www.peerdraft.app) to create an account and get started.

There is a free trail available after which you are required to pay for further use of the service.

## How to use

### Work on a document together

* Open the document you want to work on together.
* Run the command `Start shared session`. A secret link will be copied to your clipboard automatically.
* Send this link to your collaborators and start working together.

## Close a session

The session will be closed automatically, when you close the document in Obsidian. You can also:

* Run the command `Stop shared session` or
