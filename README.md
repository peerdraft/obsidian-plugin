# Collaboration for Obsidian – Sync, Share, and Edit anywhere

Collaborate instantly on Obsidian documents or folders. Choose end-to-end encrypted ad-hoc sessions or long-term sharing with support for asynchronous and offline editing. Whether for quick note-taking or building a team knowledge base, Peerdaft syncs with your collaborators' Obsidian vaults and also offers a Web Editor.

The free version lets you start unlimited ad-hoc collaboration sessions and join as many sessions from others as you want.

For long-term sharing with support for asynchronous and offline editing you need a paid account that starts at 30 USD / year and comes with unlimited free collaborators.

You can test all features for free for 14 days.

You do not need an account to join shares created by others.

## Features

###  Works instantly

Start sharing from within Obsidian and you get a secret, unguessable link. Your collaborators don't need a Peerdraft account — they can join instantly from their Obsidian vaults or browsers using the link.

###  Real-Time Collaboration

Collaborate in real-time, seeing your teammates' positions and changes instantly. Notifications alert you when someone starts working on a shared document.

###  Share folders

Keep entire folders in sync with your collaborators’ vaults. New documents created by anyone in the shared folder are synced instantly.

###  Fleeting Sessions for Ad-Hoc Collaboration

For fleeting sessions, no content passes through Peerdaft servers. Your documents and updates are exchanged end-to-end encrypted, directly between you and your peers. Fleeting Sessions end as soon as the creator leaves or closes the document. Learn about the [difference between fleeting sessions and persistent shares](https://www.peerdraft.app/documentation/explanations/what-is-the-difference-between-persistent-and-fleeting).

### Collaborators can use the Plugin or Web Editor

With the Peerdaft plugin, your collaborators can sync shared files and folders with their own vaults. No Peerdaft account is needed to import a share initiated by someone else.

Not every collaborator may use Obsidian or have it available. With the secret link created when sharing, they can access the Peerdaft Web Editor directly. The Web Editor supports both peer-to-peer fleeting sessions and working on persistent shares.
